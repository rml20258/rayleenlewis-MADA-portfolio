    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rayleenlewis/Desktop/MADA-Mac-local/rayleenlewis-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I will first choose some fun colors for each Emphasis. I will use the ggplot2 package to create this boxplot (specifying geom as geom_boxplot). Using the labs() function, I will rename the axis labels and the title of the boxplot. Then using scale_fill_manual(), I will incorporate the colors I chose earlier. With scale_y_continuous(), I will widen the scope of the y axis. Using theme(), I will put the legend at the bottom and make the axes and title bold and larger in size (as well as center the title). I will save this boxplot as “exercise2-boxplot.png”\n\ncustom_colors_boxplot &lt;- c(\"Biostat\" = \"#9eadee\", \"DAM\" = \"#9eebee\", \"Epi\" = \"#9eeea4\")\n  \nplot_boxplot &lt;- ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = Emphasis, y = Height, fill = Emphasis)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Emphasis\", y = \"Height (in cm) \", title = \"Height by Emphasis in PhD Program\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors_boxplot) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(120, 200)) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"))\n\nexercise2_boxplot = here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"results\",\"figures\",\"exercise2-boxplot.png\")\nggsave(filename = exercise2_boxplot, plot= plot_boxplot) \n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nInterpretation: From the boxplot above, it appears as though the students in the Biostat Emphasis have the highest average height and have the greatest variation in height.\nI will create a scatterplot with Weight on the X axis and GPA on the Y axis. I will use the ggplot2 package to create this scatterplot (specifying geom as geom_point). Under geom_point(), I will add a color for the points to be and I will increase their size for visibility. Using the labs() function, I will rename the axis labels and the title of the boxplot. Using theme(), I will put the legend at the bottom and make the axes and title bold and larger in size (as well as center the title). I will save this boxplot as “exercise2-scatterplot.png”\n\nplot_scatterplot &lt;- ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = Weight, y = GPA)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#9eadee\", size = 2.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of GPA against Weight \", x = \"Weight (in kg)\", y = \"GPA\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")) \n\nexercise2_scatterplot = here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"results\",\"figures\",\"exercise2-scatterplot.png\")\nggsave(filename = exercise2_scatterplot, plot= plot_scatterplot) \n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nInterpretation: It appears as though there is no true correlation between Weight and GPA as the points are all relatively spread out. There is a minimal amount of clustering in the upper left corner, however this likely isn’t significant (considering the sample size is n = 9).\nI will not run any statistical tests to assess the correlation coefficient since this was not stated as part of the instructions.\n\n\nNotes\nFor your own explorations, tables and figures can be “quick and dirty”. As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

    "text": "The staff at 538 of ABC News included a graphic showing the average regular-season home game attendance for all teams in the Big Four North American men’s professional sports leagues. This was part of their 25 coolest charts we made in 2023 list and was included in the article titled, “How Massive The NFL Really Is, In 4 Charts” by Ryan Best.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this plot was not readily accessible, so I extracted the data using a free online plot digitizer.\n\n\nMy goal was to recreate this figure using a combination of AI generated code (using ChatGPT) and my own personal tweaks.\nAs a very first step, I wanted to see what ChatGPT would give me if I only gave it the data and figure. Using the following prompt, I got a very basic plot that at least got the data points right: Using the attached data, write r code to create a plot that resembles the attached avif file\n\n#ChatGPT from first prompt of only data and figure\n# Load the data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"capacity_plot_data.csv\")\n\n# Clean column names\ncolnames(data) &lt;- trimws(colnames(data))\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Capacity Plot\", x = \"X Axis\", y = \"Y Axis\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy second prompt was tailored specifically to try to get as close to the figure as possible. The prompt was:\nUpdate the code to do the following:\n\nRemove numbers on x-axis and add the following labels “NFL” at x = 1, “MLB” at x = 2, “NBA” at x = 3, and “NHL” at x = 4.\nremove main title and axes titles.\nUse filled circles as the markers.\nFor points with x-values &lt; 1, set color to orange. For points with x values between 1 and 1.5, set color to purple. For points with an x value between 2 and 3, set color to yellow. For points with an x value between 3.5 and 5, set color to green.\nGraph and label averages for each cluster of points.\n\nThis produced code with an error or two. I tried to get ChatGPT to fix the error (related to missing a color specification), but the solutions offered didn’t fix the issue, so I fixed it myself (had to add a color to the last geom_text line).

I ended up tweaking may things myself, including creating league specific labels and locations for the labels, creating axes labels that matched the figure exactly rather than using the data as is (e.g., 90,000 was labeled as 90k), setting an aspect ratio more similar to the original figure, and even setting the figure title to have the same words on each line as the original.

The average capacity size differs by &lt;400 between the original and recreated figures for NFL venues and &lt;40 for the other leagues.\nOverall, the figures are very similar. The markers are similar colors with white borders, the labels for the league and “AVG. [mean]” are in ismilar places, means are noted with a dashed line for each league, y-axis labels are the exact same, the title is the same with the same words per line, the aspect ratio is similar, and the grid lines are similar. The created graph does not include the arrows and text going to the highest and lowest capacity venues or footnotes.\n\n\n\nI’ve never created a table in R, so I decided to take some of the advice provided in the Discussion posts about the use of AI and ask ChatGPT to “give me code to explore the features of the gt package in R to make tables.” Because I had previously used this window for helping with my chart above, it used some of the aspects from the data in its example code (e.g., men’s sports leagues), but it didn’t have any context for what the data represented, so it made up a fake dataset. The code itself threw several errors, so I used this to see what some of the basic functionality of some of the buzzwords (e.g., cols_label, tab_style).\nTo work towards the final table, I itteratively worked with ChatGPT to “build” the table and features. My first prompt was to get the results I wanted int he table: Using a data frame with two variables, Y (continuous) and league (4 level factor), write R code to create a table showing the mean (standard deviation), median (q1, q3), min, and max with p-values testing the difference in means and medians across the four groups.\nFrom here, I used prompts to implement one feature at a time. First, I focused on getting p-values. ChaptGPT provided an example of how to do this, but the p-values were at the bottom of the table, which I didn’t love, so I wrote new code to append the p-values as a column instead. Next, I focused on the footnotes. ChatGPT wrote code to add a footnote for the comparison of means testing. I used this to write my own footnote for the medians column. Next, I worked on adding histograms for each of the rows. Once I worked out this code, I wanted to take it a step further and color the histograms to match the colors from the figure above. Next, I added the descriptive footnote. I based this code off of the original error-riddled code provided from the gt exploration prompt. And, finally, I wanted to add some conditional coding. I decided to identify the lowest minimum attendance and color the cell light gray and set the font to black. ChatGPT helped with this code. I wrote my own code to similarly identify the highest maximum value in the max column and color the cell light blue and set the font to blue. The text below the table was modified to include notes on the coloring.\n#Creating a variable for league based on the x values\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(league = ifelse(x &lt; 1, \"NFL\", \n                          ifelse(x &gt;= 1 & x &lt;

    "text": "The staff at 538 of ABC News included a graphic showing the average regular-season home game attendance for all teams in the Big Four North American men’s professional sports leagues. This was part of their 25 coolest charts we made in 2023 list and was included in the article titled, “How Massive The NFL Really Is, In 4 Charts” by Ryan Best.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this plot was not readily accessible, so I extracted the data using a free online plot digitizer.\n\n\nMy goal was to recreate this figure using a combination of AI generated code (using ChatGPT) and my own personal tweaks.\nAs a very first step, I wanted to see what ChatGPT would give me if I only gave it the data and figure. Using the following prompt, I got a very basic plot that at least got the data points right: Using the attached data, write r code to create a plot that resembles the attached avif file\n\n#ChatGPT from first prompt of only data and figure\n# Load the data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"capacity_plot_data.csv\")\n\n# Clean column names\ncolnames(data) &lt;- trimws(colnames(data))\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Capacity Plot\", x = \"X Axis\", y = \"Y Axis\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy second prompt was tailored specifically to try to get as close to the figure as possible. The prompt was:\nUpdate the code to do the following:\n\nRemove numbers on x-axis and add the following labels “NFL” at x = 1, “MLB” at x = 2, “NBA” at x = 3, and “NHL” at x = 4.\nremove main title and axes titles.\nUse filled circles as the markers.\nFor points with x-values &lt; 1, set color to orange. For points with x values between 1 and 1.5, set color to purple. For points with an x value between 2 and 3, set color to yellow. For points with an x value between 3.5 and 5, set color to green.\nGraph and label averages for each cluster of points.\n\nThis produced code with an error or two. I tried to get ChatGPT to fix the error (related to missing a color specification), but the solutions offered didn’t fix the issue, so I fixed it myself (had to add a color to the last geom_text line).

I ended up tweaking may things myself, including creating league specific labels and locations for the labels, creating axes labels that matched the figure exactly rather than using the data as is (e.g., 90,000 was labeled as 90k), setting an aspect ratio more similar to the original figure, and even setting the figure title to have the same words on each line as the original.

The average capacity size differs by &lt;400 between the original and recreated figures for NFL venues and &lt;40 for the other leagues.\nOverall, the figures are very similar. The markers are similar colors with white borders, the labels for the league and “AVG. [mean]” are in ismilar places, means are noted with a dashed line for each league, y-axis labels are the exact same, the title is the same with the same words per line, the aspect ratio is similar, and the grid lines are similar. The created graph does not include the arrows and text going to the highest and lowest capacity venues or footnotes.\n\n\n\nI’ve never created a table in R, so I decided to take some of the advice provided in the Discussion posts about the use of AI and ask ChatGPT to “give me code to explore the features of the gt package in R to make tables.” Because I had previously used this window for helping with my chart above, it used some of the aspects from the data in its example code (e.g., men’s sports leagues), but it didn’t have any context for what the data represented, so it made up a fake dataset. The code itself threw several errors, so I used this to see what some of the basic functionality of some of the buzzwords (e.g., cols_label, tab_style).\nTo work towards the final table, I itteratively worked with ChatGPT to “build” the table and features. My first prompt was to get the results I wanted int he table: Using a data frame with two variables, Y (continuous) and league (4 level factor), write R code to create a table showing the mean (standard deviation), median (q1, q3), min, and max with p-values testing the difference in means and medians across the four groups.\nFrom here, I used prompts to implement one feature at a time. First, I focused on getting p-values. ChaptGPT provided an example of how to do this, but the p-values were at the bottom of the table, which I didn’t love, so I wrote new code to append the p-values as a column instead. Next, I focused on the footnotes. ChatGPT wrote code to add a footnote for the comparison of means testing. I used this to write my own footnote for the medians column. Next, I worked on adding histograms for each of the rows. Once I worked out this code, I wanted to take it a step further and color the histograms to match the colors from the figure above. Next, I added the descriptive footnote. I based this code off of the original error-riddled code provided from the gt exploration prompt. And, finally, I wanted to add some conditional coding. I decided to identify the lowest minimum attendance and color the cell light gray and set the font to black. ChatGPT helped with this code. I wrote my own code to similarly identify the highest maximum value in the max column and color the cell light blue and set the font to blue. The text below the table was modified to include notes on the coloring.\n#Creating a variable for league based on the x values\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(league = ifelse(x &lt; 1, \"NFL\", \n                          ifelse(x &gt;= 1 & x &lt;

The correlations between pcr and pcr, abbott and abbott, as well as cdc and cdc are all 1. This is expected as there should be a 100% match when a variable is compared to itself. The correlation between pcr and abbott is 0.95; the correlation between pcr and cdc is 0.95; the correlation between abbot and cdc is 0.96. These high correlation coefficients suggest that the variables are highly associated with each other.

I ran the same exploratory analyses that Rayleen did for optimal comparison of the two datasets. The exploratory tables for the categorical variables are similar between the datasets. The counts and PCTs between each table from the original and synthetic datasets are very similar. The exploratory analyses for the continuous variables are also similar. The first two graphs created from the synthetic dataset are similar to those from the original dataset. Their distribution is similar in that the reactive group has a higher mean value and is much more steep than the non-reactive group. However, for the last two graphs, the distribution is different. The synthetic dataset graphs are bimodal and the reactive and non-reactive groups seem to overlap. There is minimal overlap present in the original graphs. The correlation matrices for the variables appear to be identical between the original and the synthetic datasets."

For example, I may see a table in a paper that I would like to convert to a figure for a presentation. I decided to spend this week’s module trying to find tools that could convert a PDF or image into usable data.\nAs a learning example, I found a table online showing the Dallas Cowboys’ week 18 injury report. This table was small enough that it felt like a manageable test project, because you can see the effects of each step of processing.\n\nThis was also interesting to me personally because throughout the season, it felt like the Cowboys had many players in the same position get hurt. So, I was curious to see if there were multiple players out during the last week of the regular season who played the same position.\n\nSetup\nLoading all necessary packages.

Based on the graphic provided in this week’s Tidy Tuesday, there does appear to be a regional trend in ER visit length, but this doesn’t account for other factors. My hypothesis is that there will be significant differences in ER visit length by region, with regions 3 and 4 having higher wait times and region 8 having lower wait times on average, after adjusting for additional factors that may serve as proxies for higher standards of care (e.g., percent of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID, percent of patients that left without being seen).\n\n\n\n\nI will address this research question using 10-fold cross validation on multivariable linear regression, LASSO model, and random forest model. The LASSO and random forest models were both tuned using a grid of tuning parameter values.\n\n\nThe first model I’ll consider is a multivariable linear regression model. My outcome variable is median length of visit (OP_18b). The “exposure” is HHS region coded as a factor. State-level characteristics considered for adjustment are % healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID (HCP_COVID_19), percent left without being seen (OP_22), and safe use of opioids (SAFE_USE_OF_OPIOIDS).\n\n# Define a linear model with all predictors\nlm_all_tt &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nlm_all_wf_tt &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_model(lm_all_tt) %&gt;% \n  add_formula(OP_18b ~ region + HCP_COVID_19 + OP_22 + SAFE_USE_OF_OPIOIDS)\n\n\nlm_cv_results_tt &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  lm_all_wf_tt,\n  resamples = vfold_cv(train_tt, v = 10),\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq),\n  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)\n)\n\n# View the performance\ncollect_metrics(lm_cv_results_tt)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  .metric .estimator   mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard   36.2      10   8.36  Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 rsq     standard    0.475    10   0.121 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n# Fit model on the training data\nlm_all_fit_tt &lt;- lm_all_wf_tt %&gt;% fit(train_tt)\n\n# Compute predictions on training data\npreds_lm_all_tt &lt;- predict(lm_all_fit_tt, train_tt) %&gt;% bind_cols(train_tt)\n\n# Compute RMSE for both models\nrmse_lm_all_tt &lt;- rmse(preds_lm_all_tt, truth = OP_18b, estimate = .pred)\npaste0(\"RMSE linear model:\", rmse_lm_all_tt$.estimate)\n\n[1] \"RMSE linear model:21.392648587055\"\n\n\nThe mean (se) RMSE for the CV models was 36.26 (9.42).

For this model, several of the coefficients for region were set to 0, meaning the regions 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 were not substantially different from each other after accounting for COVID vaccination among healthcare providers and the percent of people who leave before getting treated. The RMSE for this model (32.4) is lower than the RMSE for the linear regression model using CV (36.3).\n\n\n\nThe final model being considered is the random forest model.

Looking more closely at this option, the most important variable was region followed by % of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID. This doesn’t give us any information about the differences in median visit time between regions though, just that region was important in predicting median visit time.\n\n\n\nMy model preference for this analysis is the LASSO model. This model can be used to make and interpret comparisons between HHS regions (unlike the Random Forest model), and it has a lower RMSE than the linear regression model. The reduction of some region coefficients to 0 also makes the model a bit more interpretable, because this inherently groups regions similar in visit length together into one comparison group. Betas for other regions can be interpreted as differences in visit length between a region and the comparison group of regions.\nAs a final step, I am running the test data through the LASSO model.\n\n# Make predictions on test data\nlasso_test_preds &lt;- predict(final_lasso_fit, new_data = test_tt) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(test_tt)\n\n# Calculate RMSE\nlasso_test_rmse &lt;- rmse(lasso_test_preds, truth = OP_18b, estimate = .pred)\n\n# Print RMSE\ncat(\"Test RMSE:\", lasso_test_rmse$.estimate, \"\\n\")\n\nTest RMSE: 39.2836 \n\n# Extract coefficients at the selected lambda\ncoef_matrix_test &lt;- coef(glmnet_fit, s = best_penalty$penalty)\n\n# Convert to tidy format\nlasso_coefs_df_test &lt;- as.matrix(coef_matrix_test) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"term\") %&gt;%\n  rename(estimate = `s1`)  # 's1' might differ depending on glmnet version\n\n# Filter for non-zero coefficients (variables actually used in the model)\nnonzero_lasso_coefs_test &lt;- lasso_coefs_df_test %&gt;%\n  filter(estimate != 0)\n\n# Print coefficients\nprint(nonzero_lasso_coefs_test)\n\n          term     estimate\n1  (Intercept) 122.53866488\n2      region2  42.68655692\n3      region3  21.56006921\n4      region5  -0.56115092\n5      region7  -2.99884964\n6      region8  -0.02283698\n7 HCP_COVID_19   0.97446117\n8        OP_22   6.98790645\n\nggplot(lasso_test_preds, aes(x = OP_18b, y = .pred)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"LASSO Model: Observed vs Predicted (Test Set)\",\n       x = \"Observed\",\n       y = \"Predicted\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMSE was 39.3. This model didn’t particularly fit the data well (several points are far from the observed vs predicted line), but this could just be luck of the draw in which points ended up in the test data set.\n\n\n\n\nMultivariable linear regression, LASSO regression, and Random Forest models were all performed using 10-fold cross validation. LASSO and random forest models were both tuned prior to selection of the final models; tuning parameters that resulted in the lowest RMSE values were selected for the final models. The LASSO model was selected as the final model due to interpretability and performance (i.e., lower RMSE) improvements over the other models.\nBased on the results from the LASSO regression model, after adjusting for the percent of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID and the percent of people who leave without receiving treatment, HHS regions 2 and 3 had higher median visit lengths compared to regions 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10. Region 2 (NJ, NY, PR, VI) had the highest visit length on average, which was 42 minutes longer on average. Region 7 (IA, KS, MO, NE) had the shortest visit length on average, by 3 minutes. These findings are corroborated in the box plot below of median visit length for each region, with means shown in red dots. Region 2 has the highest median and mean visit length and region 7 the lowest.\n\nggplot(train_tt, aes(x = factor(region), y = OP_18b)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"darkblue\") +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 20, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot with Means\",\n       x = \"Group\",\n       y = \"Outcome\") +\n  theme_minimal()"

    "text": "Does the median time patients spent in the emergency department before leaving from the visit vary by HHS region? Based on the graphic provided in this week’s Tidy Tuesday, there does appear to be a regional trend in ER visit length, but this doesn’t account for other factors. My hypothesis is that there will be significant differences in ER visit length by region, with regions 3 and 4 having higher wait times and region 8 having lower wait times on average, after adjusting for additional factors that may serve as proxies for higher standards of care (e.g., percent of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID, percent of patients that left without being seen)."

My outcome variable is median length of visit (OP_18b). The “exposure” is HHS region coded as a factor. State-level characteristics considered for adjustment are % healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID (HCP_COVID_19), percent left without being seen (OP_22), and safe use of opioids (SAFE_USE_OF_OPIOIDS).\n\n# Define a linear model with all predictors\nlm_all_tt &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nlm_all_wf_tt &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_model(lm_all_tt) %&gt;% \n  add_formula(OP_18b ~ region + HCP_COVID_19 + OP_22 + SAFE_USE_OF_OPIOIDS)\n\n\nlm_cv_results_tt &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  lm_all_wf_tt,\n  resamples = vfold_cv(train_tt, v = 10),\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq),\n  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)\n)\n\n# View the performance\ncollect_metrics(lm_cv_results_tt)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  .metric .estimator   mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard   36.2      10   8.36  Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 rsq     standard    0.475    10   0.121 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n# Fit model on the training data\nlm_all_fit_tt &lt;- lm_all_wf_tt %&gt;% fit(train_tt)\n\n# Compute predictions on training data\npreds_lm_all_tt &lt;- predict(lm_all_fit_tt, train_tt) %&gt;% bind_cols(train_tt)\n\n# Compute RMSE for both models\nrmse_lm_all_tt &lt;- rmse(preds_lm_all_tt, truth = OP_18b, estimate = .pred)\npaste0(\"RMSE linear model:\", rmse_lm_all_tt$.estimate)\n\n[1] \"RMSE linear model:21.392648587055\"\n\n\nThe mean (se) RMSE for the CV models was 36.26 (9.42).

For this model, several of the coefficients for region were set to 0, meaning the regions 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 were not substantially different from each other after accounting for COVID vaccination among healthcare providers and the percent of people who leave before getting treated. The RMSE for this model (32.4) is lower than the RMSE for the linear regression model using CV (36.3).\n\n\n\nThe final model being considered is the random forest model.

Looking more closely at this option, the most important variable was region followed by % of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID. This doesn’t give us any information about the differences in median visit time between regions though, just that region was important in predicting median visit time.\n\n\n\nMy model preference for this analysis is the LASSO model. This model can be used to make and interpret comparisons between HHS regions (unlike the Random Forest model), and it has a lower RMSE than the linear regression model. The reduction of some region coefficients to 0 also makes the model a bit more interpretable, because this inherently groups regions similar in visit length together into one comparison group. Betas for other regions can be interpreted as differences in visit length between a region and the comparison group of regions.\nAs a final step, I am running the test data through the LASSO model.\n\n# Make predictions on test data\nlasso_test_preds &lt;- predict(final_lasso_fit, new_data = test_tt) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(test_tt)\n\n# Calculate RMSE\nlasso_test_rmse &lt;- rmse(lasso_test_preds, truth = OP_18b, estimate = .pred)\n\n# Print RMSE\ncat(\"Test RMSE:\", lasso_test_rmse$.estimate, \"\\n\")\n\nTest RMSE: 39.2836 \n\n# Extract coefficients at the selected lambda\ncoef_matrix_test &lt;- coef(glmnet_fit, s = best_penalty$penalty)\n\n# Convert to tidy format\nlasso_coefs_df_test &lt;- as.matrix(coef_matrix_test) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"term\") %&gt;%\n  rename(estimate = `s1`)  # 's1' might differ depending on glmnet version\n\n# Filter for non-zero coefficients (variables actually used in the model)\nnonzero_lasso_coefs_test &lt;- lasso_coefs_df_test %&gt;%\n  filter(estimate != 0)\n\n# Print coefficients\nprint(nonzero_lasso_coefs_test)\n\n          term     estimate\n1  (Intercept) 122.53866488\n2      region2  42.68655692\n3      region3  21.56006921\n4      region5  -0.56115092\n5      region7  -2.99884964\n6      region8  -0.02283698\n7 HCP_COVID_19   0.97446117\n8        OP_22   6.98790645\n\nggplot(lasso_test_preds, aes(x = OP_18b, y = .pred)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"LASSO Model: Observed vs Predicted (Test Set)\",\n       x = \"Observed\",\n       y = \"Predicted\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMSE was 39.3.

For the logistic regression models modeling sex, dose was not associated with sex, which isn’t surprising. Unless doseage was dependent on some other factor associated with sex (like weight), I wouldn’t expect there to be an association here. In adjusted models, height had the strongest associations with sex."

After that, RMSE increases almost exponentially. The lowest RMSE is observed for the lowest penalty.

    "text": "Conclusions\nBased on these results, the LASSO model with a small penalty (e.g., &lt;1) seems to fit best. There is a lot of variation in RMSE by CV fold for the LASSO and random forest models, but in general the CV LASSO model had a lower RMSE (~615) than the CV random forest model (670-690 depending on the number of variables included). Both RMSEs are higher than in the models that did not use CV. Because all predictors are adding information to the model and the random forest model is a conglomeration of many models that use a subset of predictors, it is not surprising that the LASSO model has a lower RMSE."

Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/rayleenlewis/Desktop/MADA-Mac-local/rayleenlewis-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea."

(This is often called a Codebook.) For this simple example, the codebook is given as a second sheet in the Excel file.\nThis raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code."
